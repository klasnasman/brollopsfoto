Jalan and Jibril Durimel (b. Paris 1993) lived a quasi-nomadic childhood. Born to French-Caribbean parents in Paris, they spent two years on the island of Guadeloupe before moving to Miami at age four, and then to the island of St. Maarten at twelve. It was on Saint Maarten that they became inspired by cinema and set off to Los Angeles at the age of seventeen to study film. The twin brothers, who have settled back in Paris in 2020, draw inspiration from their diverse upbringing, wide exposure to different cultures, and cinematic influences. Through visual expressions their work aims to serve as a spectacle of cultural cross-pollination, and an inquiry into the decadence of simplicity.
